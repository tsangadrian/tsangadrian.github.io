            <h5>Digital Media Artist, Game Developer</h5>
            <div class="h-30"></div>
            <p>My name is Adrian Tsang. I'm a Digital Media Artist with a passion for games and immersive experiences. Growing up, gaming has been a huge part of my life, as it helped forge some of the lasting relationships I am blessed to have now. As important the sense of community gaming has brought into my life is, there has always been an enchanting feeling that came from being lost within a virtual world. For that brief moment, it feels like all of your problems, issues, and anxieties drift away as you delve into a universe someone has constructed. Within that brief window of time and space, often comes a certain magicality to it from wandering around, exploring that unknown place as an alter ego. Captured by this idea, I now pursue an exploration, figuring out how some of these inspiring creators have been able to evoke these feelings of wonder. My main mission of being an artist is to carve gateways and windows for others to experience new realities. I think as people, it's sometimes necessary to look at our world through different lenses to build new perspectives on life, to stir imagination, and to consider grand possibilities. As of now, I hold a burning passion for game development. I currently work with Unity as my preferred tool as it features a great arsenal of functions which brings high fidelity graphics to accessible platforms and a variety of devices. Along the road, I have ambitions to work with VR and AR, as I think these technologies take on the forefront of immersive experiences in today’s era.
</p>

            <p>Currently, my works carry a semi-minimalist aesthetic. Although sometimes I don’t mind loud visuals, I think my theme acts as a reflection of how my process is carried out. When making artworks, I want my viewers to not feel overwhelmed. Moreso, I value that what people take away from my art is a sense of liberation and freedom. I want people to feel acceptance of where they are currently at, what they are currently experiencing, and who they currently are. For example, this concept can be seen reflected in my work, “harmony”. This work aims to question the validity of whether or not escapism has a place in today's society, and whether or not it can serve as beneficial to modern culture. For the people experiencing the virtual installation, I wanted them to reflect on their own life in modernity as they take in the office ambience and the factory work showcased on the screens. However, the lush floral forest around them serves as a binding force to convey a peaceful state, a sanctuary where one can feel at ease for acceptance and to rationalize the issues that cut deeper—mind over matter. Very similar to a meditative experience, but the piece doesn’t facilitate that process. Rather, it serves as a catalyst for questioning and reflection. Moving forward, I plan to vehemently chase the reasons to what truly makes immersive gaming experiences special, hoping to capture imagination along the way.</p>
